# Horizontal Scroll Slider

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Project Description

Bellow is a demo of horizontal scrolling content. Currently, the content can be scrolled only from the right side.
Custom scrollbar is implemented which looks and feels same in all modern browsers.

Example is using [MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/) as a React component library, but can be adjusted to work with custom / other libraries as well.
